# HtmlCanvas

## What is it?

It's a rather recursive sounding HTML renderer written in JavaScript, contained in a HTML document!

## Why?

Why not?

## Does it support web standards such as the ACID test?

All i can say is this renderer is so good, it **re-defines** web standards!

## Can i run HTMLCanvas in HTMLCanvas in HTMLCanvas in...

One day, perhaps...
